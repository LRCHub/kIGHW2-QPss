# Avicii – True Believer

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I wasn't always the brightest, till I learn how to dance

You got me thinking love will come around but you never gave me a chance
A pride always being the tallest, till I learn how to jump
You got me thinking love will come around but you never see I'm the one
If I could make you, make you fall in love with me
If I could make you, make you fall in love

Wish I could make you, make you make you fall in love
Baby love will come around if you want it enough

Baby love will come around if you want it enough

Love will come around
If you are a true believer

If you are a true believer
Love will come around if you want it enough
Baby love will come around for us
Love will come around if you want it enough
Baby love will come around for us
Love will come around if you want it enough
Baby love will come around for us
