I am here and now because of you
You're the reason I do what I do
Like a phantom when you call me I'll be there
Any time that I'm around you shouldn't fear

Because of you
That's what I do
C'mon c'mon
Because of you
I'm a true believer

I'm a true believer
I'm with you through the night
You're my inspiration in life
I'm a true believer
So don't give up the fight
You're my inspiration in life

Gimme gimme everything you got
You and I can take it to the top
Like superheroes we can save the day
Let the music take us somewhere far away

Because of you (because of you)
That's what I do (what I do)
Come on come on
Because of you
I'm a true believer

I'm a true believer
I'm with you through the night
You're my inspiration in life

I'm a true believer
So don't give up the fight
You're my inspiration in life

I'm a true believer
I'm with you through the night
You're my inspiration in life

I'm a true believer
I'm with you through the night
You're my inspiration in life

I'm a true believer
So don't give up the fight
You're my inspiration in life
I'm a true believer
I'm with you through the night
You're my inspiration in life X2

I'm a TRUE BELIEVER!.
