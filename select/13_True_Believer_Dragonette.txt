I don't play well with the other kids
They know that I'm dangerous
It's evident, I'm different,
My punishment is imminent

They tell me that I'm no good,
They say words
That I've got a curse,
I know that it's true

But you, you make me better
You give me pleasure
It's just your effect on me
You, you make me sweeter
You give me fever and I'm a believer

I've had such a wicked time,
Kissed the boys and made them cry
Laugh and while I wave goodbye
And they'd still like another try

Roger, Larry, Dick and Tom,
Matthew, Harry, Luke, and John
If they knew who I've become, who I've become
The spell I'm under is you

You make me better
You give me pleasure
It's just your effect on me
You've taught me a lesson
Now I'm behaving
Must be what's best for me
You, you make me sweeter
You give me fever now I'm a believer

Do you feel super
I'm the new girl curled round your finger
I've taken your potion
And now I'm senseless, defenceless, a fool
The spell I'm under is you, it's you
You're just what's come over me,
You're who's has gotten into me
You who did this thing to me, I used to be so bad

But you, you make me better
You give me pleasure
Must be what's best for me
You, you make me sweeter
You give me fever I'm a believer

I'm a believer
A true believer
I'm a believer
A true believer
