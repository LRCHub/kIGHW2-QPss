I don't pretend to be a hero
We both know I'm way too flawed for that
But if you ever need a rescue
Just know that I always have your back

I'll be your true believer
The secret place you hide
Your promise never leaver
I'm always on your side

No, I won't ever slay a dragon
Or bring the devil to his knees
But if you ever need a champion
Just reach out your weary hand to me

I'll be your true believer
The secret place you hide
Your promise never leaver
I'm always on your side

Always on your team
When you feel like breaking
You can break on me
Oh, yeah, ohh

I'll be your true believer
The secret place you hide
Your promise never leaver
I'm always on your side
I'm always on your side
