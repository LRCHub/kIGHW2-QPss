Here come's another sleepless night
Trouble's runnin' my life
I just need a day to hide away
I'm feelin' all tied up inside
Break these chains that bind
The power locked in my mind

It's so true what the heroes do
Stay in the fight in the heat of battle
Showing the world that I can

Cause I'm never gonna stop or walk away
Gotta take it to the top
I know I can make it
I'm gonna live life like a winner
I'm a true believer

I'm gonna find that perfect place
They'll be some chances to take
I travel on a road so far from home

Hang on there's a danger zone straight ahead
Hold tight wrong or right
I'm gonna break through
I won't ever stop that's for true

This time I'll be changin' the game
Makin' the rules so I can break 'em
Showing the world that I can

Cause I'm never gonna stop or walk away
Gotta take it to the top
I know I can make it
I'm gonna live life like a winner
I'm a true believer 2x

Cause I'm never gonna stop or walk away
Gotta take it to the top
I know I can make it
I'm gonna live life like a winner
Like true believers do

I'm never gonna stop
Came all the way
Now I'm standin' at the top
And taking it higher
I'm gonna set this world on fire
Like only believers do
