I wasn't always the brightest
Until I learned how to dance
You got me thinking
Love will come around but
You never give me a chance
I might not have been the
tallest
Until I learned how to jump oh
You got me thinking
Love will come around
But you never say I'm the one
If I could make you
Make you fall in love with me
If I could make you
Make you fall in love
Wish I could make you
Make you fall in love
Maybe love will come around
if you want it enough
Oh oh oh yeah
Love will come around
Love will come around for us
I wasn't always the bravest
They say you only live once
So you got me thinking
I'm so glad I found you
Life's what you make so here it
comes
It goes
If I could make you
Make you fall in love with me
If I could make you
Make you fall in love
Wish I could make you
Make you fall in love
Maybe love will come around
if you want it enough
Love will come around
if you want it enough
If you're a true believer
If you're a true believer
Love will come around,
L L love will come around for us
